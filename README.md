# Pet-Adoption---Multi-Target-Prediction
This problem has multiple target for prediction with missing values.
Used Gradient Boosting for best result as tried other classifiers and Gradient Boosting gave the minimum MAE score.

Created multiple instances for each prediction and merge it in the end without connecting each prediction to each other as it will decrease the overall accuracy.
The dataset is also included above.
